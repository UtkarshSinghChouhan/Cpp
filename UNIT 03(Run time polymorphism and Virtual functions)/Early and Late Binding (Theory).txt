1. Binding means link between a Function call and the real function that is executed when the function is called.

2. When the compiler knows which function to call before execution. it is know as the STATIC BINDING or EARLY BINDING.

3. DYNAMIC BINDING or LATE BINDING means that the actual function invoked at the run time depends on the address stored in the pointer.
   In this binding, link between the function call and the actual function is made.

4. The keyword 'virtual' prevents the compiler to perform the early binding.Binding is postponed until the program  execution.
