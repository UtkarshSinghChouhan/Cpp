*********** OPERATOR OVERLOADING CONCEPTS **************

1. UNARY OPERATOR OVERLOADING:

   1.1) USING MEMBER FUNCTION:
        In this case we use zero number of arguments in the operator-function defination.
        Whenever we call the operator-function from main (like,  ++obj) , the compliler will 
        look for the definition of the operator ++ and the object/operand  will invoke(call) the function.  
 	
   1.2) USING THE FRIEND FUNCTION:
	In this case we use one argument in the operator-function definition.
        Whenever we call the operator-friend function from main (like,  ++obj), the object will 
	passed as an argument to the function and the operator will invoke(call) the function 
	just like the scenerio when we create an object/operand the constructor gets called automatically.

2. BINARY OPERATOR OVERLOADING:

   2.1) USING MEMBER FUNCTION:
	In this case we use one argument in the operator-function definition.
	Whenever we call the operator-function inside the main (like, A+B),The left handed operand is always
	used to invoke(call) the operator-function) and the right handed operand is passed as an argument.

   2.2) USING FRIEND FUNCTION:
	In this case we use two arguments in the operator-function definition.Whenever we call the friend operator
	friend function in the main (like, A+B) both the operands or objects are passed as arguments.
